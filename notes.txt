To create a new rails project I entered:
rails new word_learner --skip-test-unit

rails new creates the project

--skip-test-unit skips the creation of unit tests by default - we will add more later


Gemfile contains details of the ruby Gems that our application will use.
We are going to include the rspec-rails gem for unit testing.
Rspec is installed by default when we install rspec-rails.

Also we are including the capybara gem.

And for production we are using the postgres database.  We are using sqlite for dev and test.

Once we have specified the appropriate gems to use in the gemfile, we install the gems using:

bundle install --without production

This installs most of the gems in the Gemfile, with the exception of the gems specified with the production symbol
